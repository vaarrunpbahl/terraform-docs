Terraform Documentation Generation 
Step 1: Install Chocolatey
1. Run the following command to set the execution policy to allow the installation script to run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
2. Next, run the following command to install Chocolatey:
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
3. Wait for the installation to complete. Once done, Chocolatey will be ready to use.
4. Verify the installation by running:
choco -v
This command should return the version of Chocolatey installed on your system.
Step 2: Install `terraform-docs` Using Chocolatey
With Chocolatey installed, you can now install `terraform-docs`.
1. In the same PowerShell window, run the following command:
choco install terraform-docs
2. Wait for the installation to complete. Chocolatey will download and install `terraform-docs` on your system.
3. Verify the installation by running:
terraform-docs --version
This should return the version of `terraform-docs` installed.
Step 3: Prepare Your Terraform Project
Before generating documentation, ensure your Terraform project is correctly set up.
3.1 Directory Structure
Here is a recommended directory structure for your Terraform project:
/your-terraform-project/
│
├── main.tf              
├── variables.tf         
├── outputs.tf           
├── terraform.tfvars     
└── README.md            
3.2 File Descriptions
- **main.tf**: The primary Terraform configuration file where resources are defined.
- **variables.tf**: Contains the variable definitions that are used within your Terraform configurations.
- **outputs.tf**: Specifies the outputs from your Terraform project, which can be used by other projects or modules.
- **terraform.tfvars**: This file contains the actual values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`.
- **README.md**: The markdown file where documentation will be generated by `terraform-docs`.
Step 4: Run `terraform-docs` to Generate Documentation
1. **Navigate to your Terraform project directory:**
Open your terminal or PowerShell and navigate to the directory containing your Terraform project:
cd C:\path\to\your\terraform\project
terraform plan
terraform apply
2. **Run `terraform-docs` to generate documentation:**
Run the following command to generate the documentation:
terraform-docs markdown . > README.md
This command will scan the Terraform files in the current directory and generate documentation in markdown format, outputting it to `README.md`.
3. **Example of the Command in Action:**
Dell@Dell MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Clients/YourProject/terraform-aws-ec2 (master)
$ terraform-docs markdown . > README.md
This will create or overwrite the `README.md` file with the generated documentation.
Step 5: Review and Share the Documentation
1. **Open the generated `README.md` file** to review the documentation. You can open this file in any text editor or Markdown viewer.
2. **Ensure all sections are accurate and complete**, including detailed resource information, inputs, and outputs.
